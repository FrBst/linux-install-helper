# Linux Install Helper
Bunch of scripts and guides I put together to avoid pains when working with Linux.

## Usage
Clone this repository to your computer and run `main.sh`; this should do the trick.

## Special Thanks
- To **Windows**: for breaking GRUB every time I install an update, and for having problems with the `winload.efi` file on every single installation attempt, thus causing me to give up on Windows in particular and proprietary software in general;
- To **Realtek** and the **rtw88_8821ce** driver: for my broken soul, wasted time and almost crushed will to have anything to do with Linux;
- Probably more coming.

## Note
It may be argued that this repository was created to store all this stuff online and be able to easily update it, and also that leaving it public just might serve the community; but I will not hide that I'm actually doing this out of pure spite.
